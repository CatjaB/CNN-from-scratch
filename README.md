# CNN-from-scratch
I built a CNN from scratch using PyTorch Custom NN Modules to classify MNIST images. 

##Why did I do this?
I did this, so I can better understand how the CNN really works.

##What will I do next?
Try using matrix operations instead of using for-loops. For-loops were great for understanding the CNN, but make the algorithm really, really slow.

##What have I learned, what will I do better next time?
First of all, before starting to code, I need to know the exact input and output types, and how they look.
Further, better tests and just coding more clean & with more comments will make my life a lot easier :D

Thank you for reading this far, I hope you have a great day!
